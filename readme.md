# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
I think I'm most proud of the fact that at the beginning I had no idea where to start, and now I feel like I would have some idea of how to get the job done if asked to do it a month from now. I feel like I've really given the time this week as well.

1. What do you need to improve?
Honestly, I've always been a "learn completely, then go" kind of person. That said, this project made me very uncomfortable in that I had to do some things to get the project to work that I wasn't completely clear on. For example, I think switching my project over to a class was super challenging, because I didn't see how to make my pre-created methods into instance variables. Or the difference between what should be an instance variable and what shouldn't. Since I did all that just yesterday, I'm still pretty hazy on it. Another thing I'd want to note is the tension I felt when working with other people. It's really hard to not feel like you're cheating when you're working through a problem with other people. This was especially uncomfortable when you're working with someone and they solve the problem. Part of me wants to redo the whole project by myself this weekend so I can feel like my progress was really mine. 

1. What questions do you still have?
Understanding how instance variables and class and methods all work together. I feel pretty confident on the first half of just figuring out the algorithm, I'm just really slow in processing the logic. The second part of turning it into a class I could use a lot of work on. Github feels easier to me than the actual coding. Testing I feel like I understood as well.

# Rubric

## Functionality

Notes:

- [3] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics (3)

Notes:
I didn't use attribute accessors, although that probably would have helped.

The student(s):

- [X] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [X] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [X] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [X] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [X] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design (2)

Notes:
I'm not confident my code was readable, but I understood it. It would probably take some time to parse through. I'm also not confident I used instance variables appropriately. Also, I did work heavily with other people. I tried to restart things so I could do them on my own, but I had a lot of input from other people that helped me move forward. I'm really trying to find that balance between feeling confident to do it on my own and asking for help when I need it.

The student(s):

- [X] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [X] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing (3)

Notes:

The student(s):

- [X] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [X] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [X] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control

Notes:

The student(s):

- [X] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [X] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
